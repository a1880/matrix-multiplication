## 24-May-2025 AlphaEvolve solutions

Solutions were converted and analyzed with akDumpNumpyTensor

akDumpNumpyTensor was extended. <br/>A MatMultTensor class was introduced to cleanup the code.

Solutions validated against Brent Equations.

Some of the solutions have complex, float or extended coefficient sets, <br/>not just $\lbrace -1, +1 \rbrace$

## 17-May-2025 Solution statistics

Added statistical outputs to akExtractMatMultSolutions

Added statistics to schemes for <5x5x5_93>

## 16-May-2025 Additional scheme <4x4x4_48>

Added AlphaEvolve discovery of <4x4x4_48> to the paper

Improved akDumpNumpyTensor to validate algorithms and handle complex coefficients

## 15-May-2025 Initial Commit

Repository created

Added AlphaEvolve discovery of <5x5x5_93> to the paper
