# Matrix Multiplication

This repository is devoted to fast matrix multiplication.
"fast" means that the number of elementary products is smaller than in the classic
schoolbook method.

## Solution Schemes

The solutions provided include:

$N \times M \times P$ \_ $r$ stands for multiplication of an $N \times M$
matrix times an $M \times P$ matrix, using $r$ elementary products.
